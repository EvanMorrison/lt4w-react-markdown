<h3 style="margin-top: 50px">LIPEDEMA</h3>

Lipedema study and research is in its beginning stages. Lipedema is a progressive disease characterized by a specific pattern of accumulation of fat on the body, lumpy and painful areas within the fat, increasing adipose tissue, lymphatic fluid accumulation and an ineffectiveness of calorie-restrictive diets to control fat gain. Until recently this condition was treated with lyphemeda therapies with little success. Currently new experimental protocols are being tested.

Please give us a call to discuss these new therapies and to see if you are a candidate for receiving this promising new treatment.
